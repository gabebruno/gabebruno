## **Hi Buddies**!

### I'm Gabriel Bruno Almeida!

My hobby is writing, I like electronic games and boardgames, especially cooperative!

I'm from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· and I have good hard skills in I.T., but I am especially proud of my personal skills.

I know a little about many things and a lot about some things.

>My skills are:
>  * Development in PHP (Laravel and Code Igniter frameworks) and .Net;
>  * Knowledgement in Javascript, Docker and another technologies used on my way until here;
>  * Teamwork with Git repositories;
